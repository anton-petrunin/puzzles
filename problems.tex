\section*{Preface}

This collection is about ideas, and it is not about theory.
An idea might feel more comfortable in a suitable theory,
but it has its own life and history, and it can speak for itself.

I am collecting these problems for fun, 
but they might be used to improve 
the problem-solving skills in geometry.
Every problem has a short elegant solution ---
this gives a hint which was not available
when the problem was discovered.

%Here is one reason to read this collection.
%In your research you might face a problem that can be solved by an easy trick.
%It is a pity to miss such a trick especially since it is easy and fun to learn.
%On the other hand, learning a theory is harder and not as much fun, but if you miss it, then likely you can get help from a friend, so usually it does not stop you.

\parbf{How to read it.}
Open at a random chapter, make sure you like the practice problem --- if yes try to solve a random problem in the chapter.
A semisolution is given at the end of the chapter,
but think before reading,
otherwise it will not help. 

Some problems are marked by $\circ$, $*$, $+$ or $\sharp$.
\begin{itemize}
\item[$\circ$] --- easy problem;%\easy
\item[$*$] --- the solution requires at least two ideas;%\hard
\item[$+$] --- the solution requires knowledge of a theorem;%\thm
\item[$\sharp$] --- there are interesting solutions based on different ideas.%\many
\end{itemize}
