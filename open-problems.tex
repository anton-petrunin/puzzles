\section*{Preface}

This is a collection of open problems which I consider to be \emph{puzzles};
it means that they are contagious to my brain (I see many grips, but do not have enuf hands).

Originally, I was planning to include these problems in PIGTIKAL~\cite{petrunin2021pigtikal} --- my collection of puzzles,
but things around open problems change rapidly, so it makes more sense to separate them.

Please send me an email if you solve one of the problems, or see a good approach.
