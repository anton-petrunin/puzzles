\section*{Preface}

This is a collection of open problems which I consider to be \emph{puzzles};
it means that they are contagious for my brain;
often, it means that I see many grips, but do not have enuf hands.
I was planning to include these problems into my book of puzzles \cite{petrunin2021pigtikal},
but since things around open puzzles change more rapidly, it makes more sense to separate them.
Send me an email if you solve one of the problems, or see a good approach.
