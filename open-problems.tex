%\section*{Preface}

This is a collection of open problems in geometry that I think of as \textit{puzzles}:
they stick to my brain — I see many grips, but no spare hands.
Puzzle-charm is the only criterion for including a problem here;
importance is ignored.

Originally, I was planning to add these problems to my PIGTIKAL~\cite{petrunin2021pigtikal} (a collection of solved puzzles), but things around open problems change rapidly, so it makes more sense to separate them.

Please send me an email if you solve one of the problems, or see a good approach.
