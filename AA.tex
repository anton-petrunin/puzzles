Consider the \index{moment curv}\emph{moment curve} $\gamma_n\:t\mapsto(1,t,\dots,t^n)$  in $\RR^{n+1}$.
Let 
\[\ell_n=\length \tfrac{\gamma_n}{|\gamma_n|}.\]

Show that $\tfrac{\ell_n}{\pi}$ is the expected number of real roots of a polynomial of degree $n$ with independent normally distributed real coefficients.

\parbf{Real roots of random polynomial.}
Given a polynomial $p(t)=a_0+\dots+a_n\cdot t^n$, consider the hyperplane $\Pi$ in $\RR^{n+1}$ defined by the equation $a_0\cdot x_0+\dots+a_n\cdot x_n$.
Note that the number of real roots of $p$ equals to the number of intersections of $\Pi$ with the moment curve.

It remains to apply Crofton's formula.

\subsection*{Completion by one point}

\begin{pr}
Let $S$ be a surface equipped with a Riemannian metric of curvature $\ge 1$;
denote by $\bar S$ the completion of $S$.
Suppose that $\bar S\setminus S$ is a one-point set.
Is it true that $\diam S\le \pi$?
\end{pr}

This problem was mentioned by Changfeng Gui and Qinfeng Li
\cite[right after Theorem 1.4]{gui-li}.

It is straightforward to show that all points in $\bar S$ lie on the distance at most $\pi$ from the only point in $p=\bar S\setminus S$.
In particular, $\diam S\le 2\cdot\pi$.
Note that Alexandrov comparison around $\bar S$ might fail;
an example can be found among surfaces with rotational symmetry.

\subsection*{Curvature hollow}
\label{Curvature hollow}

\begin{pr}
Construct a Riemannian metric on $\RR^3$ 
which is Euclidean outside of an open bounded set $\Omega$ 
and with negative scalar curvature in $\Omega$.
\end{pr}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Curvature hollow.}
An example can be found among the  metrics with isometric $\mathbb{S}^1$ action which fix a line.

\medskip

First note that it is easy to construct such metric on the connected sum
$\RR^3\#\mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{S}^1$.
Indded make two holes in $\RR^3$, deform the obtained space conformally so that scalar curvature drops and the two holes fit and glue the holes to each other.
Further, note that such metric can be constructed in such a way that it has a closed geodesic $\gamma$ with trivial holonomy and with constant negative curvature in its a tubular neighborhood.

Cut tubular neighborhood $V\simeq\mathbb{D}^2\times \mathbb{S}^1$ of $\gamma$ 
and glue in the product $W\simeq\mathbb{S}^1\times \mathbb{D}^2$ with the swapped factors. 
Note that after this surgery we get back $\RR^3$.

It remains to construct a metric $g$ on $W$ with negative scalar curvature which 
is identical to the original metric on $V$ near its boundary.
The needed space $(W,g)$ can be found among wrap products $\mathbb{S}^1\times_f \mathbb{D}^2$ [see page~\pageref{page:warped product}].
\qeds


This construction was given by Joachim Lohkamp \cite[see][]{lohkamp},
he describes there yet an other equally simple construction.
In fact,
his constructions produce 
$\mathbb{S}^1$-invariant hollows 
with negative Ricci curvature.

On the other hand,
there are no hollows with 
positive scalar curvature and negative sectional curvature.
The former is equivalent to the positive mass conjecture \cite[see][and the references therein]{witten}
and the latter is an easy exercise.

\subsection*{Almost flat manifold\easy}
\label{almost-flat}

\emph{Nil-manifolds} form the minimal class of manifolds which includes a point, and has the following property:  
the total space of any principle $\mathbb{S}^1$-bundle over a nil-manifold is a nil-manifold. 

The nil-manifolds can be also defined as the quotients of a connected nilpotent Lie group by a lattice.

A compact Riemannian manifold $M$ is called $\eps$-flat if its sectional curvature at all points in all directions lie in the interval $[-\eps,\eps]$. 

The main theorem of Gromov in \cite{gromov-almost-flat}, 
states that for any positive integer $n$ there is $\eps>0$ such that any $\eps$-flat compact $n$-dimensional manifold with diameter at most $1$ admits a finite cover by a nil-manifold.
A more detailed proof can be found in \cite{buser-karcher}
and a more precise statement can be found in \cite{ruh}.

\begin{pr}
Given $\eps>0$, construct a compact Riemannian manifold $M$ of sufficiently large dimension which admits a Riemannian metric with diameter $\le 1$ and sectional
curvature $|K|<\eps$,
but does not admit a finite covering by a nil-manifold.
\end{pr}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Almost flat manifold.}
An example can be found among solve manifolds;
that is, quotients of solvable lie group by a lattice.
In fact torus bundles over circle circles are sufficient.

\medskip

A torus bundle $\TT^m\to E\to\mathbb{S}^1$ is obtained by taking $\TT^m\times [0,1]$ and gluing $\TT^m\times 0$ to $\TT^m\times 1$ along the map given by a matrix $A\in \SL(\ZZ,n)$.

The matrix $A$ has to meet two conditions.

On one hand, we need to make sure that the fundamental group of $E$ does not contain a nilpotent group of finite index.
This can be achieved by making at least one of eigenvalues of $A$ different from 1 by absolute value.

On the other hand the space $E$ has to admit a metric with small curvature and diameter, this can be achieved by making all 
eigenvalues of $A$ close enuf to 1 by absolute value.
So the $n{\times}n$ matrix 
\[A=
\left(
\begin{matrix}
0&0&\dots&0&1&1
\\
1&0&\dots&0&0&0
\\
\vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots&\vdots&\vdots
\\
0&0&\dots&0&0&0
\\
0&0&\dots&1&0&0
\\
0&0&\dots&0&1&0
\end{matrix}
\right).
\]
for large enuf $n$ does the job;
its characteristic polynomial is 
\[\lambda^n+\lambda+1.\qedsin\] 
\medskip

\label{page-sol:almost-flat}
This example was constructed 
by Galina Guzhvina \cite[see][]{guzhvina}.

It is expected that for small enuf $\eps>0$,
a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ of any dimension 
with  $\diam(M,g)\le 1$ and $|K_g|\le \eps$ cannot be simply connected,
here $K_g$ denotes the sectional curvature of $g$.

The latter does not hold with the condition $K_g\le \eps$ instead.
In fact, 
for any $\eps>0$,
there is a metric $g$ on $\mathbb{S}^3$ 
with $K_g\le \eps$ and $\diam(\mathbb{S}^3,g)\le 1$.
This example was originally constructed by Mikhael Gromov in \cite{gromov-almost-flat}; 
a simplified proof was given by 
Peter Buser
and Detlef Gromoll in \cite{buser-gromoll}.












The space $P$ can be found among the spherical polyhedral spaces which admit
an isometric circle action $\mathbb S^1\acts P$ with geodesic orbits.
One of these orbits is the singular set.

First let us construct the quotient space $P'=P/\mathbb S^1$.
Consider the Hopf action $\mathbb S^1\acts\mathbb S^3$.
Let 
\[h\:\mathbb S^3\to\CP^1=\mathbb S^3/\mathbb S^1\] 
be the quotient map.
The complex projective line $\CP^1$ is isometric to the 2-sphere of radius $\tfrac12$.

Fix large relatively prime integers $p$ and $q$. 
Consider a solid deltoid $\Delta=[nesw]$ in $\CP^1$ with angles 
\begin{align*}
\measuredangle n&=2 \cdot\tfrac\pi p,
\\
\measuredangle s&=2\cdot\tfrac\pi q,
\\
\measuredangle e=\measuredangle w&=\theta<\pi.
\end{align*}

The quotient space $P'$ is obtained from $\Delta$ by gluing its boundary to itself along the reflection symmetry.
Note that $P'$ is homeomorphic to $\mathbb S^2$ and
it has 3 singular points with total angles $2\cdot\tfrac\pi p$,
$2\cdot\tfrac\pi q$ and $2\cdot\theta$.

The required $\mathbb S^1_{p,q}$-action on $\mathbb{S}^3\subset\CC^2$ is given by complex diagonal matrices $\left(\begin{smallmatrix}z^p&0\\0&z^q\end{smallmatrix}\right)$.
The orbits with isotropy groups $\ZZ_p$ and $\ZZ_q$ correspond to $n$ and $s$ in $P'$.
There is a metric $\rho$ on  $\mathbb{S}^3$ which is invariant with respect to the $\mathbb S^1_{p,q}$-action, which has $P'$  as the quotient space and geodesic orbits. 
(In fact such metric $\rho$ is unique up to isometry.)

This space $P=(\mathbb{S}^3,\rho)$ can be constructed the following way.
Set $W=h^{-1}(\Delta)$;
let $\tilde W$ be the universal metric cover of $W$.
The $\mathbb{S}^1$-action on $W$ lifts to $\RR$-action on $\tilde W$,
so the subgroup $2\cdot\pi\cdot\ZZ<\RR$ is the group of deck transformations of the covering $\tilde W\z\to W$. 
Consider the quotient $W'=\tilde W/a\cdot\ZZ$;
note that $W'$ is a solid torus with $\mathbb{S}^1$-action and the quotient isometric to $\Delta$.
For the right choice of the constant $a$, the gluing map $\Delta\to P'$ can be lifted to a gluing map boundary of $W'\to P$.



In the constructed example 
the singular points with total angles $2\cdot\tfrac\pi p$ and
$2\cdot\tfrac\pi q$
correspond to the points with isotropy groups $\ZZ_p$ and $\ZZ_q$ of the action.
The points in $P=(\mathbb{S}^3,\rho)$ on the orbits over these points will be regular; 
that is, they admit a neighborhoods isometric to open sets in the unit 3-sphere.
The singular locus $P_s$
of $P$ corresponds to the remaining singular point of $P'$.
Note that by construction,
\begin{itemize}
\item $P_s$ is a closed geodesic with angle $2\cdot\theta$ around it and $\theta$ can take arbitrary value close to $\pi$.
\item $P_s$ forms a $(p,q)$-torus knot in the ambient $\mathbb{S}^3$.
\end{itemize}
\qedsf






















Fix large relatively prime integers $p>q$.
Choose a regular $p$-gon $K_p$ and $q$-gon $K_q$ in $\CP^1$ with equal sides.
Consider their inverse images $W_p=h^{-1}K_p$ and $W_q=h^{-1}K_q$;
let $\tilde W_p$ and $\tilde W_q$ be their universal metric covers.

The spaces $\tilde W_p$ and $\tilde W_q$ admit natural isometric actions by groups $\RR\times\ZZ_p$ and $\RR\times\ZZ_q$ respectively.
It remains to find $\ZZ$ subactions on $\tilde W_p$ and $\tilde W_q$ such that the solid toruses $\tilde W_p/\ZZ$ and $\tilde W_q/\ZZ$ can be glued together long an isometry of their boundaries which sends orbits to orbits.

Consider the quotient space $\CP^1=\mathbb S^3/\mathbb S^1$;
it is isometric to the 2-sphere of radius $\tfrac12$.
Fix large relatively prime integers $p>q$. 
Consider the solid triangle $\Delta=[nsw]$ with angles $\measuredangle n=\tfrac\pi p$, $\measuredangle s=\tfrac\pi q$ and $\measuredangle w=\pi\cdot(1-\tfrac1 p)$ in $\CP^1$.
Denote by $\hat \Delta$ the  doubling of $\Delta$ along  its boundary.
Note that $\hat \Delta$ is homeomorphic to $\mathbb S^2$ and
it has 3 singular points with total angles $2\cdot\tfrac\pi p$,
$2\cdot\tfrac\pi q$ and $2\cdot\pi\cdot(1-\tfrac1 p)$.

Consider the quotent map  $\mathbb S^3\to \mathbb S^3/\mathbb S^1$ for the $\mathbb S^1$-action on $\mathbb{S}^3\subset\CC^2$ by the diagonal matrices $\left(\begin{smallmatrix}z^p&0\\0&z^q\end{smallmatrix}\right)$, $z\in\mathbb S^1\subset\CC$.
Identify the quotient space $\mathbb S^3/\mathbb S^1$ with $\hat \Delta$ such that the singular orbits mapped to $v$ and $w$ respectively.
Let us equip $\mathbb S^3$ with a metric such that the 

Note that there is a spherical polyhedral metric $\rho$ on  $\mathbb S^3$
such that the $\mathbb S^1$-orbits become geodesics 
and the quotient space $(\mathbb S^3,\rho)/\mathbb S^1$
is isometric to $\hat \Delta$.

To construct such metric, take the inverse image $W$ of $\Delta$ under the Hopf fibration $\mathbb S^3 \to \CP^1$.
The universal cover $\tilde W$  of $W$ admits a natural $\RR$-action with geodesic orbits.
For the right choice of $\ZZ$ subaction of $\RR$,

The problem was suggested by Petr Pushkar.














\parbf{A family of sets with no section.}
Identify $\mathbb{S}^1$ with $[0,1]/(0\sim 1)$.
Given $t\in[0,\tfrac12]$,
Consider the set $K_t\subset \mathbb{S}^1$
formed by all possible sums $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n\cdot t^n$,
where $a_n$ is $0$ or $1$.

Note that $K_{t}$ is a Cantor set and $K_{\frac12}=\mathbb{S}^1$.

Denote by $\rho_t\:\mathbb{S}^1\to\mathbb{S}^1$ 
the counterclockwise rotation by angle $\frac1{1-2\cdot t}$.
Set 
\[Z_t=\left[\begin{aligned}
             Z_t&=\rho_t(K_t)&&\text{if}\ t\in[0,\tfrac12),
\\
Z_{t}&=\mathbb{S}^1&&\text{if}\ t=\tfrac12.
            \end{aligned}
\right.
\]

Note that the Hausdorff distance from $K_t$ to $K_{\frac12}=\SS^1$ converges to $0$ as $t\to\tfrac12$.
Therefore $Z_t$ is a continuous family.

Any continuous section $z(t)\in Z_t$ for $t\in[0,\tfrac12)$ can be described as
\[z(t)=\rho_t\left(\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n\cdot t^n\right)\]
for a fixed sequence $(a_n)$.
None of these can be extended continuousely to $[0,\tfrac12]$.\qeds












Let us denote by $\mathrm{N} M$ and $\T M$ the normal and tangent bundle of $M$ in the Euclidean space $\RR^n$.
Assume $m=\dim M$.

Consider the normal exponential map $\exp_M\:\mathrm{N} M\to\RR^n$ [defined on page~\pageref{page:Normal exponential map}]. Denote by $J_v$ the Jacobian of $\exp_M$ at $v\in \mathrm{N}M$.
Note that for all small $r>0$, we have
\[\vol B(M,r)
=
\int\limits_M d_p\vol_m\cdot\int\limits_{B(0,r)_{\mathrm{N}_p}}J_v\cdot d_v\vol_{n-m},\]
where $B(0,r)_{\mathrm{N}_p}$ denotes the ball in the fiber $\mathrm{N}_p\subset \mathrm{N} M$ at $p\in M$.

Fix $p\in M$.
Note that it is sufficient to show that following.
\begin{itemize}
\item[$({*})$] The integral
\[V(r)=\int\limits_{B(0,r)_{\mathrm{N}_p}}J_v\cdot d_v\vol_{n-m}\]
can be written in terms of $m$, $n$, $r$ and the Riemannian curvature tensor $R$ of $M$ at $p$.
\end{itemize}
In fact $V(r)$ is a polynomial in $r$ and its coefficient are up to a coefficient depending on $m$ and $n$ equal to the so-called Lipschitz--Killing curvatures at $p$.

Denote by $s\:\T_p\times \T_p\to \mathrm{N}_p$
the second fundamental form of $M$ [defined on page~\pageref{page:second fundamental form}].
Recall that the curvature tensor $R$ of $M$ at $p$ can be expressed the following way
\[\langle R(X, Y) V, W\rangle 
=\langle s(X,W), s(Y,V)\rangle-\langle s(X,V), s(Y,W)\rangle.\]

Fix a orthonormal basis $e_1,\dots, e_{n-m}$ in $\mathrm{N}_p$.
Consider the real-valued quadratic forms  $s_i(X,Y)=\<s_p(X,Y),e_i\>$.
Consider the tensors $R_i$ defined as 
\[\langle R_i(X, Y) V, W\rangle 
=s_i(X,W)\cdot s_i(Y,V)-s_i(X,V)\cdot  s_i(Y,W).\]
Note that 
\[R=R_1+\dots+R_{n-m}.\leqno{({*}{*})}\]

Assume $v=r\cdot e_i$ for some $r\in \RR$.
Denote by $k_{1},\dots, k_{m}$ the eigenvalues of the real-valued quadratic form  $s_i(X,Y)$.
By straightforward calculations we get 
\begin{align*}
J_{v}&=r^{n-m-1}\cdot(1+k_1\cdot r)\cdots(1+k_n\cdot r),
\\
J_{-v}&=r^{n-m-1}\cdot(1-k_1\cdot r)\cdots(1-k_n\cdot r).
\end{align*}
It follows that the sum $J_{v}+J_{-v}$ is a polynomial in $r$ and its coefficient 
symmetric polynomials of $Q_j(k_1,\dots, k_n)$; more over each monomial of $Q_j$ is a product of even number of distinct $k_i$'s.
Since each product $k_a\cdot k_b$ is the sectional curvature in the tensor $R_i$,
we get that the coefficient $Q_j(k_1,\dots, k_n)$ can be expressed in terms of the tensor $R_i$.

Using $({*}{*})$, we can sum up by $i$, we get that
\[\sum_i(J_{r\cdot e_i}+J_{-r\cdot e_i})\]
can be expressed in terms of $r$, $m$, $n$ and $R$.
Taking average for all orthonormal frames $e_1,\dots, e_{n-m}$ in $\mathrm{N}_p$
we get the needed claim.





Show that for small $r$ the integral
\[v(r)=\int\limits_{B(0,r)_{\mathrm{N}_pM}}J_V\cdot d_V\vol_{n-m}\]
is a polynomial 
of $r$ and its coefficients can be expressed in terms of the curvature tensor $R_p$.

It follows that the right hand side in $({*})$ can be expressed in terms of curvature tensor of $M$.
The problem follows since the curvature tensor can be expressed in terms of metric tensor of $M$.\qeds

\subsection*{Bounded geometry}

Denote by $\mathcal{R}$ the space of 
all Riemannian metrics on $\mathbb S^5$
with absolute value of sectional curvature $\le1$,
and injectivity radius $\ge1$.

It is easy to see that any metric $g_1\in \mathcal{R}$ 
can be connected to the canonical metric $g_0$ on $\mathbb S^5$
by a continuous family of metrics $g_t\in \mathcal{R}$ where $t\in[0,1]$.
In fact, the one parameter family of metrics $g_t$
can be found among the metrics of the type 
\[g_t=a(t)\cdot g_0+b(t)\cdot g_1,\]
where $a,b\:[0,1]\to\RR$
are smooth functions such that $a(0)=1=b(1)$ and $a(1-s)=0=b(s)$ for $s\le \tfrac13$.
In order to keep the bounds on the curvature and injectivity radius,
the functions $a$ and $b$
have to take huge values in the middle of interval.

\begin{pr}{\thm}{Bounded curvature}\label{Bounded curvature}
Fix a fast growing function, say
\[\Phi(x)=1000^{1000\cdot (x+1000)}.\]

Show that there is a metric $g_1$ 
such that 
for any family $g_t$ as above
\[\max_{t\in[0,1]}\{\vol(g_t)\}
>
\Phi(\vol(g_1)).\]
\end{pr}

The expected solution requires Novikov theorem on the algorithmic undecidability of the problem of recognition of the sphere $\mathbb S^m$  for
$m\ge 5$. 
A detailed proof of this theorem can be found in \cite{nabutovsky-NovThm}.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Bounded geometry.}
Show that there is an algorithm to estimate the Gromov--Hausdorff distance between two Riemannian manifolds given in any reasonable way.

Show that if two manifolds with bounded curvature are sufficiently close to each other then they are diffeomorphic.

Now assume contrary;
that is, for any metric $g_1\in \mathcal{R}$ there is a path $g_t$ in $\mathcal{R}$
connecting the canonical metric $g_0$ to $g_1$ such that 
\[\vol g_t\le \Phi(\vol g_1).\]

If a 5-dimensional Riemannian manifold $M$ with curvature between $\pm1$ is diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{S}^5$ 
then it can be described by a metric $g_1$ in $\mathcal{R}$.
Let $g_t$ be the path as above.

Construct a finite set $F\subset \mathcal{R}$ 
which is sufficiently dense in the set of metrics in $\mathcal{R}$ with volume at most $\Phi(\vol g_1)$.
The path $g_t$ as above can be approximated by a sequence of metrics from $F$.

Using the algorithms above one can list all such sequences.
It implies existence of algorithm 
which recognize $\mathbb S^5$ among $5$-dimensional manifolds.
The later contradicts Novikov theorem.

Instead of function $\Phi$ one can take any Turing computable function.
The problem and number of its generalizations 
are due to Alexander Nabutovsky \cite[see][]{nabutovsky-Disconnectedness}.

Recall that a closed curve 
 called \index{simple closed curve}\emph{simple} if it has no self-intersections.

\begin{pr}{}{Long geodesic}\label{Long geodesic}
Assume that the surface $\Sigma$ of a convex body $B$ in $\RR^3$
admits an arbitrary long simple closed geodesic.
Show that $B$ is a tetrahedron with equal opposite sides.
\end{pr}

}

A tetrahedron with equal opposite edges is called \emph{isosceles} it has many interesting properties.

Let us mention couple of theorems about intrinsic metric on convex surfaces which should help to solve this problem.
These theorems can be proved easily for smooth or polyhedral surfaces
and then the general case can be done by approximation.
A very short but comprehensive introduction to the subject was written by Alexander Alexandrov in \cite{alexandrov1941}.

On a convex surface (not necessary smooth) one could define 
so
called \index{curvature measure}\emph{curvature measure} which we denote further by $\kappa$.
It is the (necessary unique) non-negative measure such that for any triangle $\triangle$, we have
\[\kappa(\triangle)=\alpha+\beta+\gamma-\pi,\] 
where $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are the angles of $\triangle$, measured in the intrinsic metric of the surface.

For curvature measure, an analog of Gauss--Bonnet formula holds;
in particular for any closed convex surface $\Sigma$ in $\RR^3$
\[\kappa(\Sigma)=4\cdot\pi\]
and 
if a closed geodesic cuts a disc $D$ from $\Sigma$ then
\[\kappa(D)=2\cdot\pi.\]


%???+PIC

Further, given a triangle $\triangle$ in a metric space,
its model triangle $\tilde \triangle$ is defined as a triangle in the plane with the same side lengths.
The angles $\tilde\alpha$, $\tilde\beta$ and $\tilde\gamma$ of the model triangle are called \index{model angle}\emph{model angle}
of triangle.
The comparison theorem states that for any triangle in a surface with non-negative curvature measure its model angles do not exceed the actual angles; that is,
\[\tilde\alpha\le \alpha,\quad
\tilde\beta\le\beta,\quad
\tilde\gamma\le\gamma.\]
The same holds for the area; that is,
\[\area\tilde\triangle\le \area\triangle.\]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Long geodesic.}
By cutting the surface $\Sigma$ along a sufficiently long closed simple geodesic,
we get two discs.
The key step is to show that each of these discs 
is long and thin.

\medskip

Let $D$ be one of these discs.
Equip it with the intrinsic metric further denoted by $|{*}-{*}|_D$.


Since $\Sigma$ has non-negative curvature in the sense of Alexandrov,
so does $D$.
Choose a pair of points $p,q\in\partial D$ which maximize the distance $|p-q|_D$.
Clearly,
\[|x-p|_D,|x-q|_D\le |p-q|_D\] 
for any other point $x\in\partial D$.
By comparison, 
\[\measuredangle[x\,^p_q]\ge \tfrac\pi3.\leqno({*})\]

\lbl[b]{10,16;$\gamma_1(t)$}
\lbl[l]{12,9,-60;$\ge\tfrac\pi3$}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

The points $p$ and $q$ divide $\partial D$ into two arcs,
say $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$;
let us parametrize them by arclength from $p$ to $q$. 
Then by $({*})$
\[\tfrac{d}{dt}\left(|x-\gamma_i(t)|_D-|x-\gamma_i(t)|_D\right)
\ge
\tfrac12.\]
In particular
\[|p-q|_D\ge \tfrac18{\cdot}\length[\partial D].\]
In particular, if $\partial D$ is long 
then $D$ has large diameter.

Choose two points $x\in \gamma_1$ and $y\in\gamma_2$ sufficiently close to $p$ such that $|x-q|_D=|y-q|_D$.
By comparison 
\[\area \tilde \triangle qxy\le \area \triangle qxy\le \area \Sigma.\]
It follows that 
\[\begin{aligned}|x-y|_D&\le2\cdot\frac{ \area[\tilde\triangle(xyq)]}{|q-x|_D}
\le 
\\
&\le

Cut $D$ along a minimizing geodesic $[xy]$ into two lenses.
Denote by $L_p$ the lens with the point $p$ in it.
Note that the curvature of $L_p$ is $\alpha+\beta$, where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ the angles as on the diagram.
By comparison $\alpha\ge \tilde\measuredangle(x\,^p_y)$ 
and $\beta\ge \tilde\measuredangle(y\,^p_x)$.
Therefore curvature of $L_p$ is at least $\pi-\tilde\measuredangle(p\,^x_y)$.
In particular, if $|x-y|_D$ much less then $|p-x|_D+|p-y|_D$ then the curvature of $L_p$ is $\pi$ or just a little less.

Fix $\eps>0$.
If $\length[\partial D]$ is long enuf,
by $({*})$, 
we can find a lens $L_p$ with diameter at most $\eps$,
such that curvature $L_p$ is at least $\pi-\eps$.

Using the same construction for $p$ and $q$ in the disc $D$,
and for the two points in the other disc,
we get four lenses in $\Sigma$ each of diameter at most $\eps$ and each with curvature at least $\pi-\eps$.

\end{lpic}
\end{center}

By Gauss--Bonnet formula, the total curvature of $\Sigma$ is $4\cdot\pi$.
Since $\eps>0$ is arbitrary, we get that there are four singular points in $\Sigma$, each with curvature $\pi$
and the remaining part of $\Sigma$ is flat.

It remains to show that any surface with this property 
is isometric to the surface of a tetrahedron with equal opposite edges.
To do this cut $\Sigma$ along three geodesics which connect one singular point to the remaining three,
develop the obtained flat surface on the plane and think;
also look at the diagram.\qeds

Arguing by contradiction, let us assume that $P\subset \RR^m$
is a counterexample and $m$ takes minimal possible value.

Choose a finite cover $B_1,B_2,\dots B_n$ of $K$,
where $B_i=B(z_i,\eps_i)$ 
and $B_i\cap P=B_i\cap K_i$, 
where $K_i$ is a cone with the tip at $z_i$.

For each $i$, consider function $f_i(x)=|z_i-x|^2-\eps_i^2$.
Note that
\[W_{i,j}=\set{x\in\RR^m}{f_i(x)=f_j(x)}\]
is a hyperplane for any pair $i\ne j$.

The subset $P_{i,j}=P\cap W_{i,j}$ satisfies the same assumptions as $P$, but lies in a hyperplane.
Since $m$ is minimal, we get that $P_{i,j}$ is a polytope for any pair $i,j$.

Consider Voronoi domains 
\[V_{i}=\set{x\in\RR^m}{f_i(x)\ge f_j(x) \ \text{for any}\ j}.\]
Note that $P\cap V_i$ is formed by the points which lie on the segments from $z_i$ to a point in  $P\cap \partial V_i$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Unique geodesics imply $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$.}
Uniqueness of geodesics implies that $P$ is contractible.
In particular, $P$ is simply connected.

It remains to prove that $P$ is locally $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$;
equivalently, the space of directions $\Sigma_p$
at any point $p\in P$ is  a $\mathrm{CAT}(1)$ space.

We can assume that the statement holds in all dimensions less than $\dim P$. 
In particular, $\Sigma_p$ is locally $\mathrm{CAT}(1)$.
If $\Sigma_p$ is not $\mathrm{CAT}(1)$,
then it contains a periodic geodesic $\gamma$ of length $\ell<2\cdot\pi$,
such that any arc of $\gamma$ of length $\tfrac\ell2$ is length minimizing.

Consider two points $x$ and $y$
in the tangent cone of $p$
in directions $\gamma(0)$ and $\gamma(\tfrac\ell2)$.
Show that there are two distinct minimizing geodesics between $x$ and $y$.
The latter leads to a contradiction.

Denote by $\Gamma$ the fundamental group of $M$.

Let $(\tilde M,\tilde g)$ be universal cover of $(M,g)$ with induced Riemannian metric.
The space $(\tilde M,\tilde g)$ is isometric to a product $\RR^k\times K$, 
where $k$ is nonnegative integer and $K$ is a compact Riemannian manifold.

Denote by $G$ the isometry group of $K$.
Given a continuous one parameter family of homomorphisms $\phi_t\:\RR^k\to G$,
consider the one parameter family of diffeomorphisms of $\RR^k\times K$ to itself defined as
\[\Phi_t\:(x,k)\mapsto (x,\phi_t(x)\cdot k).\]
Denote by 
 $\tilde g_t$ pullback 
of $\tilde g$ via $\Phi_t$,
so 
\[\Phi_t\:(\RR^k\times K,\tilde g_t)\to (\RR^k\times K,\tilde g)\]
is an isometry.

It remains to find the one parameter family $\phi_t$ such that 
(1) $\tilde g_t$ is $\Gamma$-invariant for all $t$
and (2) $(M,g_1)=(\tilde M,\tilde g)/\Gamma$ admits a finite Riemannian cover by the product of a flat torus and $K$.

First assume that $\Gamma$ is acting on $\RR^k$ by parallel translations.
 




In terms of $\phi_t$, it can be formulated the following way.
There is a normal subgroup of finite index $\Gamma_0\vartriangleleft\Gamma$ such that 
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Gamma_0$ acts on $\RR^k$ by parallel translations;

Denote by $q$ a point in $M$ which lies on the maximal distance from $p$.

Consider the function $f=\cos \dist_p+\cos\dist_q$.
Note that 
\[\triangle f+m\cdot f\le 0\] 
in the sense of distributions.
If follows that $f\ge 0$, in particular 
\[B(p,\tfrac\pi2)\cup B(q,\tfrac\pi2)=M.\]

Set \[a(r)=\area(\partial [B(q,r)\setminus B(p,\tfrac\pi2)]).\]
Prove that the function
\[r \mapsto \tfrac{a(r)}{(\sin r)^{m-1}}\]
is nonincreasing 
and 
\[\tfrac{a(r)}{(\sin r)^{m-1}}\le\area\mathbb{S}^{m-1}.\]
Moreover if equality holds for some $r$ then $B(q,r)\setminus B(p,\tfrac\pi2)$ is isometric to an $r$-ball in the unit sphere.
This statement is analogous to the Bishop--Gromov inequality and can be proved the same way.

Finally note that $a(\tfrac\pi2)=\area\mathbb{S}^{m-1}$,
hence the result follows.

Assume a fundamental group of a compact manifold $M$ admits an epimorphism to the free group with two generators.
In other words, there are two disjoint closed hypersurfaces $S_1$ and $S_2$ in $M$ 
which do not separate points in $M$
but each $S_i$ separates points of any of its small neighborhoods.

Prepare many copies of $M$, cut one copy along $S_1$ and $S_2$,
$n_1$ copies along $S_1$ and $n_2$ copies along $S_2$
then glue them as it shown on the picture. 
It produce a finite cover of $M$ which is after rescaling is close to figure eight.

We will construct a compact totally discontinous subset $K\subset\RR^3$ without isolated points

Then the problem will follow
since any compact totally discontinous set and without isolated points
is homeomorphic to the Cantor set.

The needed set can be obtained as intersection $K=\bigcap_n K_n$
of a nested sequence 
of sets $K_1\supset K_2\supset\dots$, where each $K_n$ is a union of finite collection of solid tori. 
The construction can be guessed from the first two itarations shown on the picture.

Assume $\Sigma$ contains a closed curve with curvature $1$.

Assume we have at least two singular points with positive curvature in $\Pi$.
Choose two of them,

\textit{Flexible convex polyhedron.}
Assume contrary; i.e., there is a convex polyhedron $P$ which admits a flexible triangulation $\tau$. 
Denote by $P^t$ the continuous deformation of $P$ which moves each triangle $\triangle_1,\dots,\triangle_n$ of $\tau$ 
by motions $m_1^t,\dots,m_n^t$ of $\RR^3$.
Given triangle edge or vertex of $\tau$, we will mark by upper index $t$ the corresponding object in $P^t$; 
for example $\triangle_i^t=m^t_i(\triangle_i)$.

Denote by $v_1,v_2,\dots,v_k$ the vertices of $\tau$.
We can assume that one of the triangles, say $[v_1v_2v_3]$ of $\tau$ does not move in the deformation.

Let us choose a sequence $t_n\to 0$ and set 
\[\eps_n=\max_i\{|v_i^{t_n}-v_i|\}.\leqno{({*})}\]

Prove that if $v_i$ and $v_j$ lie in one face of $P$ then
\[|v_i^{t_n}-v_j^{t_n}|=|v_i-v_j|+O(\eps_n^2).\leqno{({*}{*})}\]

Passing to a subsequence if necessary,
we can assume that the limit
\[w_i=\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{v_i^{t_n}-v_i}{\eps_n}\] 
is defined for each $i$.
Note that $w_1=w_2=w_3=0$,
$|w_i|\le 1$ for each $i$ 
and $|w_k|=1$ for some $k$.

Note that from the equation $({*}{*})$ it follows that $w_i$ restricted to the vertices of the original polyhedron gives its  infintesimal deformation;
i.e., 
\[\<v_i-v_j,w_i-w_j\>=0\]
for any edge $[v_iv_j]$ of the polyhedron.
The latter contradicts Dehn's theorem on the infinetesimal rigidity of simplicial polyhedron.

Consider a pair of points $v\in V$ and $w\in W$ which realize the minimum of the distance.

Note that the minimizing geodesic $[vw]$ is unique and it is normal to each of the hypersurface at the end points.
In particular the parallel translation of the tangent hyperplane $\T_vV$ along $[vw]$ gives the tangent hyperplane $\T_wW$.

Consider pairs of unit-speed geodesics $\alpha$ and $\beta$ 
in $V$ and $W$ respectively 
which start at $v$ and $W$ and go in the parallel directions. 
Set $\ell(t)=|\alpha(t)-\beta(t)|_M$.

Use the second variation formula to show that $\ell''(0)$ has negative average value. 
In particular $\ell''(0)<0$ for a pair $\alpha$ and $\beta$ as above
and therefore  $v$ and $w$ is not a minimal pair, a contradiction.



















\chapter{letter of S. Tabachnikov}

Dear AHTOH, here are my (sorry, much belated!) comments on your list
of geometry problems. I will be happy to provide more details if you
wish. Do you include open problems? Privet, Serezha

1. Spiral. A reference to Kneser's theorem is appropriate: as long as
the curvature is monotonic, the osculating circles are nested.???

2. A curve in a sphere. Isn't it an immediate consequence of integral
geometry (length=const \times average number of intersections with
great circles)?

3.

4. Convex polygon. This is known as Cauchy Lemma; this was the main
ingredient in his proof that convex polyhedra in 3-space are rigid.

5. Convex triangulations. I think, this is discussed, with
references, in Gelfand-Kapranov-Zelevinsky book.

6. Short curve in a sphere. Doesn't it follow from integral geometry
that every open interval of this curve doesn't intersect some grat
circle?

7. Transversal foliation. To this I'd add that a non-vanishing
divergence free vector field on a closed 3-mfld with finite
fundamental group is not tangent to any foliation. This is proved in
my 1989 Func. Anal. note.

I don't know whether the following results qualifies for your list.

A. Given partition of a square into triangles of equal areas, the
number of triangles is even. There are many generalizations. E.g.,
the same holds for a centrally symmetric polygon. There is literature
on this subject.

B. Let G be a closed convex plane curve and g a closed immersed curve
inside G. Then average absolute curvature (g) \geq that of G, with
equality iff g is G, possibly traversed more than once. Average
absolute curvature = integral of abs. value of curvature divided by
total length.
For G a circle, this is an old Fary theorem (I know a few proofs);
for arbitrary G this was proved recently (there are two papers).



\chapter{letter of P. Petersen}

Peter Petersen 	to Anton

I'll be happy to make a few corrections.
In the problem a la Abresch-Gromoll you use Minkowski space for finite
dimensional normed vector space. This is a bit confusing to those who
think of Minkowski spaces as space-times!
In the Immerses convex hypersurface problem the third and last question
should say nonnegative (sectional) curvature rather than nonpositive which
is the second question.
In Fixed points of conformal mappings the dimension should be even? The
antipodal map on S^3 has no fixed points. Actually you might want to say
that in even dimensions the map is orientation preserving and in odd
dimensions it is orientation reversing. 
Then the problem should be correct.

And here are two problems I have always liked.
1. Show that if a
simply connected
compact positively curved manifold admits a totally geodesic hypersurface,
then it is a sphere. Actually one just needs to know that the hypersurface
is two sided.
2. Show that two minimal hypersufaces in positive Ricci curvature must
intersect.
