\chapter{Curves}

Recall that a \index{curve}\emph{curve} is a continuous map 
from a real interval into a space (for example, Euclidean plane)
and 
a {}\emph{closed curve} is a continuous map defined on a circle.
If the map is injective then the curve is called {}\emph{simple}.

We assume that the reader is familiar with related definitions including 
length of curve 
and its curvature.
The necessary material is covered in the first couple of lectures 
of a standard introduction to differential geometry, [see Part I in \ncite{petrunin-zamora}, Chapter 1 in \ncite{toponogov-curves-and-surfaces}, or \S26--27 in \ncite{hilbert-cohn-vossen}].

\medskip

We give a practice problem with a solution --- after that, you are on your own.

\subsection*{Spiral}
\label{spiral}

The following problem states that 
if you drive on the plane and turn the steering wheel to the right all the time,
then you will not be able to come back to the same place.

\begin{pr}
Let $\gamma$ be a smooth regular plane curve with strictly monotonic curvature. 
Show that $\gamma$ has no self-intersections.
\end{pr}

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{35 mm}
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-102}
\end{wrapfigure}

\parit{Semisolution.}
The trick is to show that the osculating circles of $\gamma$ are nested.

\medskip

Without loss of generality we may assume that the curve is parametrized by its length and its
curvature decreases.

Let $z(t)$ be the center of the osculating circle at $\gamma(t)$
and $r(t)$ its radius.
Note that 
\begin{align*}
z(t)&=\gamma(t)+\tfrac{\gamma''(t)}{|\gamma''(t)|^2},
&
r(t)&=\tfrac{1}{|\gamma''(t)|}.
\end{align*}

Straightforward calculations show that
\[|z'(t)|= r'(t).\]
Note that the curve $z(t)$ has no straight arcs;
therefore 
\[|z(t_1)-z(t_0)|<r(t_1)-r(t_0).\leqno({*})\]
if $t_1>t_0$.

Denote by $D_t$ the osculating disk of $\gamma$ at $\gamma(t)$;
it has a center at $z(t)$ and radius $r(t)$.
By $({*})$, $D_{t_1}$ lies in the interior of $D_{t_0}$ for any $t_1>t_0$.
Hence the result follows.\qeds

This problem was considered by Peter Tait \cite{tait}
and later rediscovered by Adolf Kneser \cite{kneser}.
The osculating circles of the curve give a peculiar decomposition of an annulus into circles; it has the following property: if a smooth function is constant on each osculating circle it must be constant in the annulus \cite[see Lecture 10 in][]{fuchs-tabachnikov}.
The same idea leads to a solution of the following problem: %???

\begin{pr}
Let $\gamma$ be a smooth regular plane curve with strictly monotonic curvature. 
Show that no line can be tangent to $\gamma$ at two distinct points.
\end{pr} %???monotone or monotonic???



It is instructive to check that the 3-dimensional analog does not hold;
that is, there are self-intersecting smooth regular space curves with strictly monotonic curvature. 

Note that if the curve $\gamma(t)$ is defined for $t\in[0,\infty)$ and its curvature tends to $\infty$ as $t\to \infty$, 
then the problem implies the existence of the limit of $\gamma(t)$ as $t\to\infty$.
The latter result could be considered as a continuous analog of the Leibniz test for alternating series.

\subsection*{Capture a sphere in a knot\hard}
\label{Capture a sphere in a knot}

such that the map $[0,1]\times \mathbb{S}^1\to\RR^3$ is smooth.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Rectifiable curve}
\label{Rectifiable curve}

For the following problem we need the notion of 
\index{Hausdorff measure}\emph{Hausdorff measure}.
Choose a compact set $X\subset\RR^2$ and $\alpha>0$.
Given $\delta>0$, set
\[h(\delta)=\inf\left\{\,\sum_i(\diam X_i)^\alpha\,\right\},\]
where the greatest lower bound is taken over all finite coverings $\{X_i\}$ of $X$ 
such that $\diam X_i<\delta$ for each $i$.

Note that the function $\delta\mapsto h(\delta)$ is not decreasing in $\delta$.
In particular, $h(\delta)\to \mathcal{H}_\alpha(X)$ as $\delta\to 0$ for some (possibly infinite) value $\mathcal{H}_\alpha(X)$.
This value $\mathcal{H}_\alpha(X)$ is called the $\alpha$-dimensional Hausdorff measure of $X$.

\begin{pr}
Let $X\subset \RR^2$ be a compact connected set
with finite 1-dimensional Hausdorff measure. 
Show that there is a rectifiable curve passing thru all the points in $X$.
\end{pr}

\subsection*{Shortcut\hard}

\begin{pr}
Let $X\subset \RR^2$ be a compact connected set. 
Show that any two points $x,y\in X$ can be connected by a path $\alpha$ such that the complement $\alpha\setminus X$ has arbitrary small length.
\end{pr}

Note that it might be impossible to connect $x$ and $y$ by a path in~$X$.
In fact there are connected sets in the plane (for example the pseudo-arc) that contain no curves.

\subsection*{Straight set}

A set $X$ in the plane is called $\delta$-straight if for any disc $\DD(x,r)$ with radius $r>0$ and center at a point $x\in X$, the intersection 
$X\cap \DD(x,r)$ is $\delta\cdot r$-close in the sense of Hausdorff to a diameter of $\DD(x,r)$. 

\begin{pr}
Show that for any $\eps>0$ there is $\delta>0$ such that any $\delta$-straight closed plane set $X$ is a curve that admits a locally $(1\pm\eps)$-bi-H\"older parametrization.
That is, $X$ is connected and for any $x\in X$ there is a curve $\alpha\:[0,1]\to \RR^2$ that covers a neighborhood of $x$ in $X$ and the inequality
\[c\cdot |t_1-t_0|^{1+\eps}\le|\alpha(t_0)-\alpha(t_1)| \le C\cdot |t_1-t_0|^{1-\eps}\]
holds for any $t_0$ and $t_1$ and positive constants $c$ and $C$,
\end{pr}

Before trying to solve the problem, it might be useful to look at the following example.
Consider the set $X_k$ formed by the origin and the two logarithmic spirals $\rho = \pm e^{k\varphi}$ in the polar coordinates $(\rho,\phi)$.
Observe that if $k$ is large, then $X_k$ is $\delta$-straight.

%\begin{figure}[h!]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[scale=.65]{mppics/pic-110}
%\end{figure}

Another example of $\delta$-straight set is shown; it is constructed in a way similar to Koch snowflake curve, where we used a very obtuse isosceles triangle instead of equilateral.
The Hausdorff dimension of this example is larger than 1;
in particular it shows that one can not expect to have a Lipschitz parametrization of $X$.




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Typical convex curves}

Formally we do not need it in the problem, 
but it is worth noting that the curvature of a convex curve is defined almost everywhere;
it follows from the fact that monotonic functions are differentiable almost everywhere.

\begin{pr}
Show that \emph{most} of the convex closed curves in the plane
have vanishing curvature at every point where it is defined.
\end{pr}

We need to explain the meaning of the word ``most'' in the formulation;
it uses \index{Hausdorff distance}\emph{Hausdorff distance} and \index{G-delta set}\emph{G-delta sets}.

The Hausdorff distance $|A-B|_H$ between two closed bounded sets $A$ and $B$ in the plane is defined by 
\[|A-B|_H=\sup_{x\in\RR^2}\{|\dist_A(x)-\dist_B(x)|\},\]
where $\dist_A(x)$ denotes the smallest distance from $A$ to $x$.
Equivalently, $|A-B|_H$ can be defined as the greatest lower bound of the positive numbers $r$ such that the $r$-neighborhood of $A$ contains $B$ and the $r$-neighborhood of $B$ contains $A$.

It is straightforward to show that the Hausdorff distance defines a metric on the space of all closed plane curves.
The obtained metric space is locally compact.
The latter follows from the \index{selection theorem}\emph{selection theorem} \cite[see \S18 in][]{blaschke},
which states that closed subsets of a fixed closed bounded set in the plane form a compact set with respect to the Hausdorff metric. 

A G-delta set in a metric space $X$ is defined as a countable intersection of open sets.
According to the \index{Baire category theorem}\emph{Baire category theorem}, 
in locally compact metric spaces $X$,
the intersection of a countable collection of open dense sets 
has to be dense.
(The same holds if $X$ is complete, but we will not need it.)

In particular, in $X$, 
the intersection of a finite or countable collection of G-delta dense sets is also a G-delta dense set. 
It means that each G-delta dense set contains {}\emph{most} of $X$.
This is the meaning of the word {}\emph{most} used in the problem.



\section*{Semisolutions}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\parbf{Moon in a puddle.}
In the proof we will use the \emph{cut locus}
of $F$ with respect to its boundary (also known as \emph{medial axis}.);
it will be further denoted by $T$.
The cut locus can be defined as the closure
of the set of points $x\in F$ 
for which there exist two or more points in $\partial F$ minimizing the distance to $x$.

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{36 mm}
\vskip-2mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-112}
\end{wrapfigure}

For each point $x\in T$, consider the subset $X\subset\partial F$ where minimal distance to $x$ is attained.
If $X$ is not connected then we say that $x$ is a \emph{cut point};
equivalently it means that for any sufficiently small neighborhood $U\ni x$, 
the complement $U\setminus T$ is disconnected.
If $X$ is connected 
then we say that $x$ is a \emph{focal point};
equivalently it means that the osculating circle to $\partial F$ at any point of $X$ is centered at $x$.

The trick is to show that $T$ contains a focal point, say $z$.
Since $\partial F$ has curvature of at most $1$, the radius of any osculating circle is at least $1$.
Hence the distance from $\partial F$ to $z$ is at least 1,
and the statement will follow.

\medskip

After a small perturbation
of $\partial F$ we may assume that
$T$ is a graph embedded in
$F$ with finite number of edges.

Note that $T$ is a
deformation retract of $F$.
The retraction $F\to T$ can be obtained the following way:
(1) given a point $x\in F\setminus T$,
consider the (necessarily unique) point $\hat x\in \partial F$ that minimize the distance $|x-\hat x|$ and
(2) move $x$ along the extension of the line segment $[\hat x x]$ behind $x$ until it hits $T$.

In particular, $T$ is a tree.
Therefore $T$ has
an end vertex, say $z$.
The point $z$ is focal since there are arbitrary small neighborhoods $U$ of $z$ such that the complements $U\setminus T$ are connected.
\qeds

We proved a slightly stronger statement, namely \textit{there are at least two points on $\partial F$ which osculating circles lie in $F$}.
Note that these points are \index{vertex of curve}\emph{vertices} of $\partial F$;
that is, they are critical points of its curvature.

Note further that inversion respects osculating circles.
That is, if $\gamma$ is an osculating circle of curve $\alpha$ at $t_0$,
$\gamma'$ is the inversion of $\gamma$, and 
$\alpha'$ is the inversion of $\alpha$,
then $\gamma'$ is an osculating circle of curve $\alpha'$ at $t_0$.
Therefore applying an inversion about a circle with the center in $F$, we also get a pair of osculating circles of $\partial F$ which surround $F$.
This way we obtain 4 osculating circles that lie on one side of $\partial F$.
The latter statement is a generalization of the four-vertex theorem \cite{petrunin-zamora:moon}.

The case of convex curves of this problem appears in a book of Wilhelm Blaschke \cite[see \S 24 in][]{blaschke}.
In full generality, the problem was discussed by Vladimir Ionin and German Pestov \cite{pestov-ionin}. %???include ref to my lectures 
A solution via curve shortening flow of a weaker statement 
was given by Konstantin Pankrashkin \cite{pankrashkin}.
The statement still holds if the curve fails to be smooth at one point \cite{petrunin-zamora:moon}.
A spherical version of the later statement 
was used by Dmitri Panov and me \cite{panov-petrunin-ramification}.

The statement admits a generalization to curves that bound a disc $F$ in a surface with nonpositive curvature.
The latter can be used to prove the following problem which was suggested by Dmitri Burago.

\begin{pr}
Let $\gamma$ be a closed space curve with curvature at most 1.
Show that $\gamma$ cannot be filled by a disc with area less than $\pi$.
\end{pr}


As you can see from the following problem, the 3-dimensional analog of this statement does not hold.

\begin{pr}
Construct a smooth embedding $\mathbb{S}^2\hookrightarrow \RR^3$ 
with all the principal curvatures between $-1$ and $1$
such that it does not surround a ball of radius~1.
\end{pr}

Such an example can be obtained by fattening a nontrivial contractible 2-complex in $\RR^3$ 
[Bing's house constructed in \ncite{bing} will do the job].
This problem is discussed by Abram Fet and Vladimir Lagunov \cite{lagunov-2,lagunov-fet} 
and it was generalized to Riemannian manifolds with boundary by Stephanie Alexander and Richard Bishop \cite{alexander-bishop}.

A similar argument shows that for any Riemannian metric $g$ on the 2-sphere $\mathbb S^2$ 
and any point $p\in(\mathbb S^2,g)$ there is a minimizing geodesic $[pq]$ with conjugate ends.
On the other hand, for $(\mathbb S^3,g)$ this is not true.
Moreover there is a metric $g$ on $\mathbb{S}^3$ 
with sectional curvature bounded above by arbitrary small $\eps>0$ and $\diam(\mathbb{S}^3,g)\le 1$.
In particular, $(\mathbb S^3,g)$ has no minimizing geodesic with conjugate ends.
An example was originally constructed by Mikhael Gromov \cite{gromov-almost-flat}; 
a simplification was given by 
Peter Buser
and Detlef Gromoll \cite{buser-gromoll}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Wire in a tin.}
To solve this problem,
you should imagine that you travel on a train along the curve $\alpha(t)$
and watch the position of the center of the disk in the frame of your train car.

\medskip

Denote by $\ell$ the length of $\alpha$.
Equip the plane with complex coordinates so that $0$ is the center of the unit disk.
We can assume that $\alpha$ is equipped with an $\ell$-periodic parametrization by arc length.

Consider the curve $\beta(t)=t-\tfrac{\alpha(t)}{\alpha'(t)}$.
Observe that 
\[\beta(t+\ell)=\beta(t)+\ell\] 
for any $t$.
In particular 
\[\length (\beta|_{[0,\ell]}) 
\ge 
|\beta(\ell)-\beta(0)|
=
\ell.\leqno({*})\]

Also 
\begin{align*}
|\beta'(t)|&=|\tfrac{\alpha(t)\cdot\alpha''(t)}{\alpha'(t)^2}|\le
\\
&\le|\alpha''(t)|.
\end{align*}
Since $|\alpha''(t)|$ is the absolute curvature of $\alpha$ at $t$,
the result follows from $({*})$.\qeds

The statement was originally proved 
by Istv\'an F\'ary in \cite{fary};
several different proofs are discussed by Serge Tabachnikov [see \ncite{tabachnikov} and also 19.5 in \ncite{fuchs-tabachnikov}].

Note that the same argument works for curves in the unit ball.

If instead of the disk we have a region bounded by a closed convex curve $\gamma$, 
then it is still true that the average curvature of $\alpha$ is at least as big as the average curvature of $\gamma$. 
The proof was given by Jeffrey Lagarias
and Thomas Richardson [see \ncite{lagarias-richardson} and also \ncite{nazarov-petrov}].


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Curve on a sphere.} 
Let us present two solutions.
We assume that $\alpha$ is a closed curve in $\mathbb{S}^2$ of length $2\cdot\ell$ that intersects each equator.

\parit{A solution with the Crofton formula.}
Given a unit vector $u$, denote by $e_u$ the equator with pole at $u$.
Let $k(u)$ be the number of intersections
of $\alpha$ and $e_u$.

Note that for almost all $u\in \mathbb{S}^2$, the value $k(u)$ is even or infinite.
Since each equator intersects $\alpha$, we get $k(u)\ge 2$ for almost all $u$.

Then we get
\begin{align*}
2\cdot\ell&=\tfrac14\cdot\int\limits_{\mathbb{S}^2}k(u)\cdot\, d_u\area\ge 
\\
&\ge\tfrac12\cdot\area\mathbb{S}^2=
\\
&=2\cdot\pi.
\end{align*}

The first identity above is called the \index{Crofton formula}\emph{Crofton formula}.
To prove this formula, start with the case when the curve is formed by one geodesic segment,
summing up we get it for broken lines
and by approximation it holds for all curves.
\qeds

\parit{A solution by symmetry.}
Let $\check\alpha$ be a sub-arc of $\alpha$ of length $\ell$, with endpoints $p$ and $q$. 
Let $z$ be the midpoint of a minimizing geodesic $[pq]$ in $\mathbb{S}^2$. 

Let $r$ be a point of intersection of $\alpha$ with the equator with pole at~$z$. 
Without loss of generality we may assume that $r\in\check\alpha$. 

The arc $\check\alpha$ together with its reflection with respect to the point $z$ forms a closed curve of length $2\cdot \ell$ passing thru both $r$ and its antipodal point $r^{*}$.
Therefore 
\[\ell=\length \check\alpha\ge |r-r^{*}|_{\mathbb S^2}=\pi.\]
Here $|r-r^{*}|_{\mathbb S^2}$ 
denotes the angle metric in the sphere $\mathbb S^2$.\qeds

Different solutions of this problem are discussed in a short note of Robert Foote \cite{foote};
the second proof is due to Stephanie Alexander.
The problem was suggested by Nikolai Nadirashvili.
It is nearly equivalent to the Fenchel's theorem: 

\begin{pr}
Show that total curvature of any closed smooth regular space curve is at least $2\cdot\pi$.
\end{pr}

A way more advanced problem is to show that any embedded circle of total curvature at most $4\cdot\pi$ is unknotted.
It was solved independently by Istv{\'a}n F{\'a}ry \cite{fary-knot} and John Milnor \cite{milnor}. 
Later many interesting generalizations and refinements were found including a generalization to singular spaces 
by Stephanie Alexander and Richard Bishop \cite{alexander-bishop:knot} and the
theorem on embedded minimal disk proved by Tobias Ekholm, 
Brian White
and Daniel Wienholtz \cite{EWW}.

\parbf{Oval in an oval.}
Choose the a chord that divides the area of the bigger oval in the minimal (or maximal) ratio.

If the chord is not divided into equal parts, then you can rotate it slightly
to decrease the ratio.
Hence the problem follows.
\qeds

\parit{Alternative solution.}
Given a unit vector $u$, denote by $x_u$ the point on the inner curve
with outer normal vector $u$.
Draw a chord of outer curve that is tangent to the inner curve at $x_u$;
denote by $r\z=r(u)$ and $l=l(u)$ the lengths of the segments of this chord to the right and to the left of $x_u$, respectively.

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{25 mm}
\vskip-2mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-107}
\end{wrapfigure}

Arguing by contradiction, assume that $r(u)\z\ne l(u)$ for all $u\in\mathbb{S}^1$.
Since the functions $r$ and $l$ are continuous,
we can assume that 
$$r(u)<l(u)\ \ \text{for all}\ \ u\in\mathbb{S}^1.\leqno{({*})}$$

Prove that
each of the following two integrals 
\begin{align*}
\tfrac12\cdot\int\limits_{\mathbb{S}^1}r^2(u)\cdot du
\quad\text{and}\quad
\tfrac12\cdot\int\limits_{\mathbb{S}^1}l^2(u)\cdot du
\end{align*}
give the area between the curves.
In particular, 
the integrals are equal. 
The latter contradicts $({*})$.\qeds



This is a problem of Serge Tabachnikov \cite{tabachnikov-mi}.
A closely related {}\emph{equal tangents problem} is discussed by the same author in \cite{tabachnikov-tan}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Capture a sphere in a knot.}
We can assume that the knot lies on the sphere $\partial B$.

Choose a M\"obius transformation 
$m\:\mathbb{S}^2\to\mathbb{S}^2$ close to the identity and not a rotation.

Note that $m$ is a conformal map;
that is, there is a function $u$ defined on $\mathbb{S}^2$ 
as 
\[u(x)=\lim_{y,z\to x}\frac{|m(y)-m(z)|}{|y-z|}.\]
(The function $u$ is called the \emph{conformal factor} of $m$.)

Applying the area formula for $m$,
we get 
$$\frac1{\area \mathbb{S}^2}\cdot\int\limits_{\mathbb{S}^2} u^2=1.$$ 
By Bunyakovsky inequality, 
$$\frac1{\area \mathbb{S}^2}\cdot\int\limits_{\mathbb{S}^2} u<1.$$ 

It follows that after a suitable rotation of $\mathbb{S}^2$, 
the map $m$ decreases the length of the knot.

Iterating this construction we get a sequence of knots $f_n\:\mathbb{S}^1\z\to\mathbb{S}^2$ with length decreasing  and tending to zero.
Passing to the limit as $m\to\id$, we get a continuous one parameter family of M\"obius transformations which shorten the length of the knot.
Therefore it drifts the knot to a single hemisphere and allows the ball to escape.

This is a problem by Zarathustra Brady,

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\parbf{Linked circles.} 
Denote the linked circles by $\alpha$ and $\beta$. 

Choose a point $x\in\alpha$. 
Note that there is a point $y\in\alpha$ such that the line segment 
$[xy]$ intersects $\beta$, say at $z$. 
Indeed, if this is not the case, 
applying a homothety with center $x$ to $\alpha$, would shrink it to $x$ without crossing $\beta$.
The latter contradicts that $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are linked.

Let $\alpha^{*}$ be the image of $\alpha$ under the central projection onto the unit sphere around $z$.
Since $|\alpha(t)-z|\ge1$ for any $t$, we have that
$$\length \alpha\ge \length\alpha^{*}.$$

Observe that $\alpha^{*}$ is a closed spherical curve that contains two antipodal points,
one corresponds to $x$ and the other to $y$.
It follows that
$$\length \alpha^{*}\ge 2\cdot\pi.$$
Hence the result follows.\qeds



This problem was proposed by Frederick Gehring \cite[see 7.22 in][]{gehring};
solutions and generalizations are surveyed in \cite{mateljevic}. 
The presented solution is attributed to Marvin Ortel in \cite{CJKSW} and it is very close to the solution given by Michael Edelstein and Binyamin Schwarz \cite{edelstein-schwatz}.

By the Kirszbraun theorem, there is a 1-Lipschitz map $f\:\RR^2\to\RR^2$ 
such that $f(\gamma_2(v))\z=f(\gamma_1(v))$ for any $v\in\mathbb S^1$.

Note that $f(C_2)\supset C_1$.
Hence the statement follows.\qeds

\parbf{Crooked circle.}
A continuous function $f\:[0,1]\to [0,1]$
will be called $\eps$-crooked 
if $f(0)=0$, $f(1)=1$ 
and for any segment $[a,b]\subset [0,1]$ 
one can choose $a\le x\le y\le b$ 
such that
\[|f(y)-f(a)|\le\eps\ \ \text{and}\ \ |f(x)-f(b)|\le\eps.\]

A sequence of $\tfrac1n$-crooked maps can be constructed recursively. 
Figure out the construction looking at the following diagram.

Now, start with the unit circle, 
$\gamma_0(t)=(\cos 2\pi t,\sin 2 \pi t)$.
Choose a sequence of positive numbers $\eps_n$ converging to zero very fast. 
Construct recursively a sequence of simple closed curves $\gamma_n\:[0,1]\z\to\RR^2$ such that $\gamma_{n+1}$ runs outside of the disk bounded by $\gamma_n$
and 
\[|\gamma_{n+1}(t)-\gamma_n\circ f_n(t)|<\eps_n,\]
for some $\eps_n$-crooked function $f_n$.
(It is hard to draw $\gamma_{n+1}$; it runs like crazy back-and-forth almost along $\gamma_n$.)

Denote by $D$ the union of all disks bounded by the curves $\gamma_n$.
Clearly $D$ is homeomorphic to an open disk.
For the right choice of the sequence $\eps_n$, 
the set $D$ is bounded.
By construction, the boundary of $D$ contains no simple curves. \qeds

In fact, the only curves in the boundary of the constructed set are constant. Compare to the problem \emph{Simple path} on page~\pageref{Simple path}.

The proof uses the so-called \emph{pseudo-arc} 
constructed by Bronis\l{}aw Knaster \cite{knaster}.
The proof resembles construction of the Cantor set.
Here are few similar problems:


\begin{pr}
 Construct three distinct open sets in $\RR$ with the same boundary.
\end{pr}

\begin{pr}
 Construct three open disks in $\RR^2$ having the same boundary.
\end{pr}

These disks are called \index{lakes of Wada}\emph{lakes of Wada}; it is described by Kuniz\^{o} Yo\-ne\-ya\-ma \cite{yoneyama}.

\begin{pr}
 Construct a Cantor set in $\RR^3$ with a non-simply connected complement.
\end{pr}

This example is called \index{Antoine's necklace}\emph{Antoine's necklace} \cite{antoine}.

\begin{pr}
 Construct an open set in $\RR^3$ with a fundamental group isomorphic to the additive group of rational numbers.
\end{pr}

\parbf{Rectifiable curve.}
The 1-dimensional Hausdorff measure will be denoted by $\mathcal{H}_1$. 

Set $L=\mathcal{H}_1(K)$.
Without loss of generality, we may assume that $K$ has diameter $1$.

Since $K$ is connected, we get 
\[\mathcal{H}_1(B(x,\eps)\cap K)\ge\eps\leqno(*)\]
for any $x\in K$ and $0<\eps<\tfrac12$.

Let $x_1,\dots, x_n$ be a maximal set of points in $K$ with 
\[|x_i-x_j|\z\ge\eps\] for all $i\ne j$. 
From $(*)$ we have $n\le2\cdot L/\eps$.

Note that there is a tree $T_\eps$ with vertices $x_1,\dots, x_n$ and straight edges with length at most $2\cdot\eps$ each.
Therefore the total length of $T_\eps$ is below $2\cdot n\cdot\eps\le 4\cdot L$.
By construction, 
$T_\eps$ is $\eps$-close to $K$ in the Hausdorff metric.

Clearly, there is a closed curve $\gamma_\eps$ whose image is $T_\eps$ and its length is twice the total length of $T_\eps$;
that is, 
\[\length\gamma_\eps\le 8\cdot L.\]

Passing to a subsequential limit of $\gamma_\eps$ as $\eps\to 0$,
we get the needed curve. \qeds

In terms of measure, the optimal bound is $2\cdot L$;
if in addition the diameter $D$ is known then it is $2\cdot L-D$.
The problem is due to 
Samuel Eilenberg 
and Orville Harrold 
\cite{eilenberg-harrold};
it also appears in the book of Kenneth Falconer \cite[see Exercise 3.5 in][]{falconer}.

\parbf{Shortcut.} 
Choose $\eps>0$.
Let us construct a set $X'\subset X$ 
 and a collection of paths $\alpha_0,\dots,\alpha_n$ such that 
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item the total length of $\alpha_i\setminus X$ is at most $\eps$,
\item the set $X'$ is a union of a finite collection of closed connected sets $X_0,\dots,X_n$,
\item diameter of each $X_i$ is at most $\eps$,
\item $x\in\alpha_0$, $y\in\alpha_n$, and
\item the union $X'\cup \alpha_0\cup\dots\cup\alpha_n$ is connected
\end{enumerate}

Imagine that the construction is given.
Let us show that the statement can be proved by applying this construction recursively for a sequence of $\eps_n$ that converges to zero very fast.

Indeed we can apply the construction to each of the subsets $X_n$ and take as $X''$ the union of all closed subsets provided by the construction.
This way we obtain a nested sequence of closed sets $X\supset X'\supset X''\supset\dots$ which break into a finite union of closed connected subsets of arbitrary small diameter and a countable collection of arcs with total length at most $\eps_1+\eps_2+\dots$ 
outside of $X$.
Consider the Cantor set 
\[Y= X\cap  X'\cap X''\cap\dots\]
Note that there is a simple curve from $x$ to $y$ that runs in the constructed arcs and $Y$.
The total length of the constructed curves outside of $X$ can not exceed the sum
$\eps_1+\eps_2+\dots$;
whence the result.

It remains to do the construction.

Let us cover $X$ by a grid of $\tfrac\eps2$-squares $Q_1,\dots,Q_k$.
Denote by $\Delta$ the union of all the sides of the squares.

By the regularity of length, we may cover $\Delta\cap X$ by a finite collection of arcs with total length arbitrarily close to the length of $\Delta\cap X$.
Denote these arcs by $\alpha_0,\dots,\alpha_n$.
Without loss of generality we may assume that $x\in\alpha_0$ and $y\in\alpha_n$.

Consider a finite graph with vertices labeled by $\alpha_0,\dots,\alpha_n$;
two vertices $\alpha_i$ and $\alpha_j$ are connected by an edge if there is a connected set $\Theta\subset  X\cap Q_k$ 
for some $k$ such that $\Theta$ intersects $\alpha_i$ and $\alpha_j$.
Note that the graph is connected. Therefore we may choose a path from $\alpha_0$ to $\alpha_n$ in the graph.

The path corresponds to a sequence of arcs $\alpha_i$ and a sequence of $\Theta$-sets.
The $\Theta$-sets that correspond to the edges in the path can be taken as $ X_i$ in the construction.
\qeds

This solution was found by Taras Banakh \cite{banakh};
it was used by Stephan Stadler and the author \cite{petrunin-stadler:revisited}.
The proof works only in dimension two and we are not aware of a generalization to higher dimensions. 
Namely the following question is open:

\begin{pr}
Let $x,y$ be two points in a compact connected subset $X\subset \RR^3$. 
Is it always possible to connect $x$ and $y$ by a path $\alpha$ such that the complement $\alpha\setminus X$ has arbitrary small length?
\end{pr}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Straight set.}
A set $L$ in the plane will be called $r$-reachable
if it is formed by a collection of disjoint proper smooth curves 
with $r$-tubular neighborhood;
that is, the closest-point projection to $L$ is uniquely defined in the $r$-neighborhood of $L$.
Note that in this case $L$ has curvature at most $\tfrac1r$ at any point.

Further $\delta_i$ will denote a positive value that depends on $\delta$ such that $\delta_i\to0$ as $\delta\to 0$.
In fact every statement below holds for $\delta_i=239\cdot\delta$ for any $i$.
We assume that $\delta$ and, therefore, each $\delta_i$ are small.

Fix an $\delta$-straight set $X$.
Note that for any $r>0$ there is a $r$-reachable set $L$ 
that is $\delta_1\cdot r$-close to $X$ in the sense of Hausdorff.
Indeed, using $\delta$-straightness one may approximate $X$ by a polygonal line that has sides about $r$, very obtuse angles and that does not come close to a fixed point twice.
Smoothing its corners produces $L$.
\begin{figure}[ht!]
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-114}
\end{figure}

Let $L_n$ be a sequence of such approximations for $r_n=\tfrac1{2^n}$.
Note that $L_{n-1}$ lies in a $\delta_2\cdot r_n$-neighborhood of $L_{n}$.
In particular the closest point projection $f_n\:L_{n-1}\to L_{n}$ is uniquely defined.
Moreover it is straightforward to check that $f_n$ is $(1\mp \delta_3)$-bi-Lipschitz.

Given $x_1\in L_1$, consider the sequence $x_n\in L_n$ defined by $x_{n+1}\z=f_n(x_n)$.
From above, we have that 
\[
\begin{aligned}|x_{n+1}-x_n|&<\delta_4\cdot r_n,
&
|x_{n+1}-y_{n+1}|&\gtrless(1\mp\delta_4)\cdot |x_{n}-y_{n}|.
\end{aligned}
\eqno({*})
\]
In particular, for any $x_1\in L_1$, the sequence $(x_n)$ converges in it-self.
Denote its limit by $F(x_1)$;
evidently $F\:L_1\to X$ is onto.
It follows in particular, that any pair of points in $X$ on distance at most 1 lie in one connected component.
Since the $\delta$-straightness does not depend on scale, it implies that $X$ is connected.

Note that $({*})$ implies the following two pairs of inequalities
\begin{align*}
|x_{n+1}-y_{n+1}|&\le (1+\delta_5)\cdot |x_{n}-y_{n}|,
\\
|x_{n+1}-y_{n+1}|&\le|x_{n}-y_{n}|+ \delta_5\cdot r_n,
\intertext{and}
|x_{n+1}-y_{n+1}|&\ge (1-\delta_5)\cdot |x_{n}-y_{n}|,
\\
|x_{n+1}-y_{n+1}|&\ge |x_{n}-y_{n}|- \delta_5\cdot r_n.
\end{align*}
To prove that $F$ is bi-H\"older,
apply recursively the first inequality in each pair until $|x_{n}-y_{n}|\z>r_n$ and after the second one. 
\qeds

This puzzle is a baby case of the so-called \emph{Reifenberg's lemma}.
It was introduced by Ernst Reifenberg \cite{reifenberg} and became a useful tool in metric geometry, in particular it is used to study the limit spaces with lower Ricci curvature bound \cite{cheeger-colding-1, naber}.

\parbf{Typical convex curves.}
Denote by $\mathfrak{C}$ the space of all closed convex curves in the plane equipped with the Hausdorff metric.
Recall that $\mathfrak{C}$ is locally compact.
In particular, by the Baire theorem, a countable intersection of everywhere dense open sets is everywhere dense.

Note that if a curve $\gamma\in\mathfrak{C}$ 
has nonzero second derivative at some point $p$,
then it lies between two circles with one of them tangent to the other from inside at $p$.

Fix these two circles.
It is straightforward to check that there is $\eps>0$ such that 
the Hausdorff distance from any convex curve $\gamma$ squeezed between the circles 
to any convex $n$-gon is at least $\frac{\eps}{n^{100}}$.

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{41 mm}
\vskip-0mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-116}
\end{wrapfigure}

Choose a countable dense set of convex polygons $\mathfrak{p}_1,\mathfrak{p}_2,\dots$ in $\mathfrak{C}$.
Denote by $n_i$ the number of sides in $\mathfrak{p}_i$.
For any positive integer $k$,
consider the set $\Omega_k\subset\mathfrak{C}$ defined by 
\[\Omega_k
=
\set{\xi\in \mathfrak{C}}{\min_i\{|\xi-\mathfrak{p}_i|_{H}\}<\tfrac1{k\cdot n_i^{100}}},\]
where $|{*}-{*}|_H$ denotes the Hausdorff distance 

From the above we get that $\gamma\notin\Omega_k$ for some $k$. 

Note that $\Omega_k$ is open and everywhere dense in $\mathfrak{C}$.
Therefore 
\[\Omega=\bigcap_k\Omega_k\]
is a G-delta dense set.
Hence the statement follows.\qeds

This problem states that typical convex curves have an unexpected property.
In fact, this is a very common situation --- it is hard to see the typical objects and these objects often have surprising properties.

For example, as it was proved by
Bernd Kirchheim, 
Emanuele Spadaro 
and 
L{\'a}szl{\'o} Sz{\'e}kelyhidi,
typical 1-Lipschitz maps from the plane to itself preserve the length of all curves \cite{KSS}.
In the same way one could show that the boundaries of typical open sets in the plane contain no nontrivial curves, 
but the construction of a concrete example is not trivial
[see ``Crooked circle'', page \pageref{Crooked circle}].
More problems of that type are surveyed by Tudor Zamfirescu \cite{zamfirescu}.
